Description of the CodeRefactoringExample Java Program
The provided code demonstrates code refactoring and performance optimization by comparing two methods for finding even numbers from a large list of integers. The program generates performance reports that highlight the improvements made through refactoring. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key features and components of the code:

1. Main Method
The main method serves as the entry point to the program, executing both the inefficient and optimized versions of the even-number finding algorithm and generating a performance report based on the execution times.

Steps:
Generate a large list of integers (1 to 1,000,000) using generateLargeList.
Measure the time taken by the inefficient method (findEvenNumbersInefficient).
Measure the time taken by the optimized method (findEvenNumbersOptimized).
Generate a performance report using the generatePerformanceReport method.
2. Generate Large List (generateLargeList)
This method generates a list of integers from 1 to the specified size.

Input: The size of the list (1,000,000 in this example).
Output: A list of integers from 1 to size.
3. Inefficient Method for Finding Even Numbers (findEvenNumbersInefficient)
This method iterates over the entire list of numbers and checks if each number is even. If it is, the number is added to the result list.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the list.
Description: A basic for-each loop is used, which works but is less efficient when the list size is large due to its sequential nature.
4. Optimized Method for Finding Even Numbers (findEvenNumbersOptimized)
The optimized version uses Java Streams and processes the data in parallel to improve performance.

Steps:
Streams: The list is converted into a stream using numbers.stream().
Parallel Processing: The .parallel() method enables parallel processing, which divides the work across multiple threads.
Filtering: The filter(num -> num % 2 == 0) step selects even numbers.
Collection: The collect(Collectors.toList()) method collects the filtered even numbers into a list.
Advantages:
Using parallel streams helps improve performance, especially for large lists, as the processing is done in parallel using multiple CPU cores.
5. Performance Report Generation (generatePerformanceReport)
This method generates a detailed report comparing the performance of the original (inefficient) and optimized methods. The report includes:

Original Method:
Time taken by the inefficient method.
Size of the output list (number of even numbers found).
Optimized Method:
Time taken by the optimized method.
Size of the output list (number of even numbers found).
Performance Improvement:
The difference in time between the original and optimized methods.
The percentage improvement in execution time.
Saving Report to a File: The report is saved to a file named PerformanceReport.txt. If there is an error writing to the file, an error message is displayed.
6. Key Features of the Program
Code Refactoring: The code compares two methods for finding even numbers, demonstrating how the refactored code can be more efficient.
Performance Measurement: The program records the execution times for both methods and compares them.
Parallel Streams: The optimized method leverages parallel streams to take advantage of multi-core processors for faster execution.
Report Generation: A detailed performance report is generated and saved to a file, allowing for an easy comparison of the two methods.
